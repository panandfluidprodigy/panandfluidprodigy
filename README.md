- 👋 Hi, I’m Evelyn, pseudo-nomically going as panandfluidprodigy.
- 👀 I’m interested in linking a GitHub account to Discord to look cool.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing related to GitHub, but I'm out of college now.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something non-GitHub related in the future.
- 📫 You can reach me through my Discord, panandfluidprodigy#3487, or through my Instagram page, panandfluidprodigy.
